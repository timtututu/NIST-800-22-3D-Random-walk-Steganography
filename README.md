# NIST-800-22-3D-Random-walk-Steganography
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d013a249-8bcf-42ce-991d-07c909a8bdba)

Our primary goal is to verify whether the PUF-based TRNG is sufficiently random.

# finalAnalysisReport
This is the result of testing our data using the NIST 800-22b standard.

# Steganography
This is our code for encrypting the image using our random number generator.

# 3D_random_walk
This is our code for visualizing the random numbers as a random walk in 3D space.
